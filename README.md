#I joined Ikure techsoft for an internship, over there I was given a wonderful project. A project destined to touch the life of millions. 
I developed two android apps from scratch single handedly within 8 days. The first app is to be used by the employees of the company to upload 
about the medical facilities that will be availed by patients(ex ECG, Tests, Prescriptions). The second app is to be used by the patients themselves 
to keep a track of their own medical records including various test reports. The set of apps provides a comprehensive healthcare solution
probably one of the best that is present in the market. The QR based system is robust and failsafe. The cutting edge tech is way to go in future.


This repository gives the source code for the patient-side app.
